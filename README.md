This repository contains two main components:

## 1. üìö Patterns

Implementations of classic software design patterns based on:
- ** book : "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"** by the Gang of Four (GoF)
- ** book : "Cocoa Design Patterns"** (Objective-C focus)
### Language:
- Swift (GoF patterns)
- Objective-C (Cocoa-specific patterns)

## 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic_Examples

A collection of algorithmic problems and solutions, focusing on:

- Grid-based traversal (e.g. flood fill, DFS, BFS)
- Island and lake detection
- Generic recursive and iterative algorithms
- Dynamic examples based on https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pEzcVLdj7T4fv5mrNhsOvffBnsUH07GZk7c2jD-adE0/edit?gid=0#gid=0
- Algorithghs based https://github.com/raywenderlich/alg-materials.git or https://github.com/kodecocodes/alg-materials
